COVID19CASEGRAPHS is a repository that will contain various time series graphs of cases and deaths
from the COVID19 data set also reposited here in github by Johns Hopkins.
Initially I am plotting for US States and Canadian Provinces and Australian States/Territories.

The graphs will be found in folders named by date, and are provided in PDF format. 
My graphs are free to use, share, for public use with attribution information included. This includes journalists, who are welcome to use
for their own education or for their own articles. Educators welcome too. Please use. Please educate suring this pandemic. 

Data used from Johns Hopkins resository is from:
